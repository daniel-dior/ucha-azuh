                            Accelerating Africa's Fintech Future Through Growth Marketing and Product Strategy
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ucha Azuh is a growth and product marketing professional who has spent 6+ years building audiences, marketing systems, and scalable growth strategies for tech companies across Africa—and is now driving business acquisition and demand generation at Quidax, one of Nigeria's first SEC-licensed cryptocurrency exchanges.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Currently, as Marketing Executive at Quidax, Ucha leads demand generation efforts and focuses on business acquisition, working directly on all new and current B2B pages for the platform. This role positions her at the intersection of crypto, fintech, and regulatory compliance—critical areas as Africa's cryptocurrency market continues to mature.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Her journey began in media—writing stories at The Guardian Nigeria and building Cloout, a tech newsletter—before transitioning into social media marketing at TechCabal in 2020. At TechCabal, she led the social media team from less than 100,000 to over 500,000 followers (approaching 1 million) across platforms in under three years, establishing herself as one of Africa's most effective social media strategists in the tech space.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Beyond social media, Ucha has led full marketing teams as Head of Marketing at an EdTech company, where she identified their primary B2B acquisition channel and drove measurable growth. She also served as Product Marketing Manager at PressOne Africa—a communications software company transforming how African businesses connect with customers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ucha is deeply interested in Web3, blockchain technology, and cryptocurrency, actively exploring the sector both personally and professionally. She's particularly fascinated by how digital currencies and decentralized finance can solve Africa's cross-border payment challenges, inflation concerns, and financial inclusion gaps—which is why her move to Quidax represents a strategic career pivot into the crypto space she's been studying.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With expertise spanning social media marketing, growth marketing, event marketing, and product marketing, Ucha brings a rare combination of audience-building skills, conversion optimization, and product-led growth thinking—making her ideally suited for fintech and crypto companies looking to scale across African markets.
                        </p>
                        <p class="about-summary">
